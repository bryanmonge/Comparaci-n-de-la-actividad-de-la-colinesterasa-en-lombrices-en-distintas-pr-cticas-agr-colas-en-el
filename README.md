In agricultural activities, the use of pesticides is useful for controlling them, the  organophosphates and carbamates are among the most used chemical compounds.  Earthworms have receptors on their bodies that cause sensitivity to these compounds.  Therefore, in the study of the impact of pesticides on the soil, the cholinesterase activity  biomarker in Lumbricus Terrestris earthworms is very useful in determining the severity of  soil damage. For this reason, the present investigation seeks to compare the magnitude of  cholinesterase activity between each type of land use practice given the climatic season.
